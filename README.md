# Image-Classification

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify images of people as either happy or sad. The model is built using a sequential neural network architecture. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (happysad.ipynb) that covers the entire process of training, evaluating, and testing the model.

# Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. The required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:  

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
The main component of this repository is the Jupyter Notebook:

happysad.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training the image classification model to classify images as happy or sad.

Running the Notebook
1. Open the Notebook:
   Open happysad.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Follow the Instructions:
   Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.

# Model Training
The happysad.ipynb notebook covers the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset containing images labeled as happy or sad.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images, including resizing and normalization, to prepare them for training.
3. Model Definition: Define a sequential neural network architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.
4. Model Training: Train the model using the preprocessed data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set and visualize the results.
